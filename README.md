## About

The <b>Vigen√®re Cipher</b> is a simple web-based tool that allows users to perform both <b>encryption and decryption</b> using the Vigen√®re cipher. The Vigen√®re cipher is a classical method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

This project provides a user-friendly interface for entering plaintext and keys and visualizes the encryption and decryption processes with animated transitions. The web app supports <b>Japanese and English</b> languages and provides a smooth user experience.

## Features

- Perform Vigen√®re encryption on input text with a key.
- Perform Vigen√®re decryption on encrypted text with the same key.
- Visualize the encryption and decryption processes with animations.
- Support for Japanese and English languages, with a language switch feature.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Easy integration with server-side logic for encryption and decryption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Web server (for server-side encryption and decryption, if required)

### Run

#### webserver
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sky9262/Vigenere-Cipher.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
    cd Vigenere-Cipher
```

3. Run the following command:
```bash
    py app.py
```

4. Enjoy !!!

#### terminal
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sky9262/Vigenere-Cipher.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Vigenere-Cipher

3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   #for japanese
   py JP_Vigen√®re_Cipher.py

         #OR

   #for english
   py EN_Vigen√®re_Cipher.py

### One lineer
```bash
py JP_Vigen√®re_Cipher.py -o encrypt -t "Hello World, How are you?" -k thisismykey
```
#### Here `-o`, `-t` and `-k` are options :
- `-o` --> Operation (encrypt / decrypt)
- `-t` --> Input text (plain text / encrypted text)
- `-k` --> Key


## Usage

1. Open the web app in your web browser.

2. Choose the language (English or Japanese) using the language switch feature.

3. Select the "Encryption" tab to encrypt plaintext or the "Decryption" tab to decrypt text.

4. Enter the input text in the "Plain Text" or "Encrypted Text" field.

5. Enter the encryption/decryption key in the "Key" field.

6. Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to initiate the process. The text transition will be visualized with animations.

7. View the result in the "Encrypted Text" or "Plain Text" field, depending on whether you encrypted or decrypted the text.
